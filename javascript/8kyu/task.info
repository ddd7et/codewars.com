Create a function (or write a script in Shell) that takes an integer as an argument and returns "Even" for even numbers or "Odd" for odd numbers.

function even_or_odd(number) {
  // ...
}

Test.assertEquals(even_or_odd(2), "Even")
Test.assertEquals(even_or_odd(0), "Even")
Test.assertEquals(even_or_odd(7), "Odd")
Test.assertEquals(even_or_odd(1), "Odd")

2. You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

function positiveSum(arr) {
  
}

Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([1,2,3,4,5]),15);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([1,-2,3,4,5]),13);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([]),0);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]),0);
Test.assertEquals(positiveSum([-1,2,3,4,-5]),9);

Very simple, given a number, find its opposite.

Examples:

1: -1
14: -14
-34: 34

function opposite(number) {
  //your code here
}


Test.assertEquals(opposite(1), -1,)

It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

function removeChar(str){
 //You got this!

};

Test.describe("Tests", function(){

Test.assertEquals(removeChar('eloquent'), 'loquen');
Test.assertEquals(removeChar('country'), 'ountr');
Test.assertEquals(removeChar('person'), 'erso');
Test.assertEquals(removeChar('place'), 'lac');
  
});

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Example:

makeNegative(1); // return -1
makeNegative(-5); // return -5
makeNegative(0); // return 0
makeNegative(0.12); // return -0.12

function makeNegative(num) {
  // Code?
}

Test.assertEquals(makeNegative(42), -42);

Write a function called repeat_str which repeats the given string src exactly count times.

repeatStr(6, "I") // "IIIIII"
repeatStr(5, "Hello") // "HelloHelloHelloHelloHello"

function repeatStr (n, s) {
  return '';
}

describe("Tests", function() {
  it ("Basic tests", function() {
    Test.assertSimilar(repeatStr(3, "*"), "***");
    Test.assertSimilar(repeatStr(5, "#"), "#####");
    Test.assertSimilar(repeatStr(2, "ha "), "ha ha ");
  });
});

Simple, remove the spaces from the string, then return the resultant string.

function noSpace(x){

}

Test.describe("Example tests",_=>{
Test.assertEquals(noSpace('8 j 8   mBliB8g  imjB8B8  jl  B'), '8j8mBliB8gimjB8B8jlB');
Test.assertEquals(noSpace('8 8 Bi fk8h B 8 BB8B B B  B888 c hl8 BhB fd'), '88Bifk8hB8BB8BBBB888chl8BhBfd');

Given an array of integers your solution should find the smallest integer.

For example:

    Given [34, 15, 88, 2] your solution will return 2
    Given [34, -345, -1, 100] your solution will return -345

You can assume, for the purpose of this kata, that the supplied array will not be empty.

class SmallestIntegerFinder {
  findSmallestInt(args) {
    
  }
}

Test.describe("Smallest Integer Tests", _ => {
  Test.it("Fixed Tests", __ => {
    var sif = new SmallestIntegerFinder();
    Test.assertEquals(sif.findSmallestInt([78,56,232,12,8]),8,'Should return the smallest int 8');
    Test.assertEquals(sif.findSmallestInt([78,56,232,12,18]),12,'Should return the smallest int 12');
    Test.assertEquals(sif.findSmallestInt([78,56,232,412,228]),56,'Should return the smallest int 56');

Summation

Write a program that finds the summation of every number from 1 to num. The number will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

For example:

summation(2) -> 3
1 + 2

summation(8) -> 36
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

var summation = function (num) {
  // Code here
}

describe('summation', function () {
  it('should return the correct total', function () {

This time no story, no theory. The examples below show you how to write function accum:

Examples:

accum("abcd") -> "A-Bb-Ccc-Dddd"
accum("RqaEzty") -> "R-Qq-Aaa-Eeee-Zzzzz-Tttttt-Yyyyyyy"
accum("cwAt") -> "C-Ww-Aaa-Tttt"

The parameter of accum is a string which includes only letters from a..z and A..Z.

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#Examples:

Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"

#Input

A word (string) of length 0 < str < 1000 (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

#Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

In this little assignment you are given a string of space separated numbers, and have to return the highest and lowest number.

Example:

highAndLow("1 2 3 4 5");  // return "5 1"
highAndLow("1 2 -3 4 5"); // return "5 -3"
highAndLow("1 9 3 4 -5"); // return "9 -5"

Notes:

    All numbers are valid Int32, no need to validate them.
    There will always be at least one number in the input string.
    Output string must be two numbers separated by a single space, and highest number is first.

Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number and concatenate them.

For example, if we run 9119 through the function, 811181 will come out, because 92 is 81 and 12 is 1.

Note: The function accepts an integer and returns an integer

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

    In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
Examples

-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") == true
isIsogram("aba") == false
isIsogram("moOse") == false // -- ignore letter case

Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

Examples input/output:

XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

More similar exercise are found here http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/ (source)

aden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.

Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.

Example:

Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

Given two integers a and b, which can be positive or negative, find the sum of all the numbers between including them too and return it. If the two numbers are equal return a or b.

Note: a and b are not ordered!
Examples

GetSum(1, 0) == 1   // 1 + 0 = 1
GetSum(1, 2) == 3   // 1 + 2 = 3
GetSum(0, 1) == 1   // 0 + 1 = 1
GetSum(1, 1) == 1   // 1 Since both are same
GetSum(-1, 0) == -1 // -1 + 0 = -1
GetSum(-1, 2) == 2  // -1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 2

In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out.
Example

filter_list([1,2,'a','b']) == [1,2]

In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?

At the end of the first year there will be: 
1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants

At the end of the 2nd year there will be: 
1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (number of inhabitants is an integer)

At the end of the 3rd year there will be:
1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213

It will need 3 entire years.

More generally given parameters:

p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)

the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.

aug is an integer, percent a positive or null number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)

Examples:
nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15
nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10

Note: Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.

Usually when you buy something, you're asked whether your credit card number, phone number or answer to your most secret question is still correct. However, since someone could look over your shoulder, you don't want that shown on your screen. Instead, we mask it.

Your task is to write a function maskify, which changes all but the last four characters into '#'.
Examples

maskify("4556364607935616") == "############5616"
maskify(     "64607935616") ==      "#######5616"
maskify(               "1") ==                "1"
maskify(                "") ==                 ""

If the number is prime return the string '(integer) is prime' (null in C#) (use Either String a in Haskell and Result<Vec<u32>, String> in Rust).
Example:

divisors(12); // should return [2,3,4,6]
divisors(25); // should return [5]
divisors(13); // should return "13 is prime"
